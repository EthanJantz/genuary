I had this idea of obfuscating the letters of "GENUARY" by converting them into a color palette. The palette generation works by taking the distances between each letter and then converting those to distances across hue values on a color wheel. The result ( you can see if you look at render(o0)) is a color palette that starts from a seeded original value that I mapped to the location of the mouse.  You can also change the  seed word if you want to see how the effect looks for other words!
